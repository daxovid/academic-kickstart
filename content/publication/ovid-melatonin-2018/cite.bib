 abstract = {Endocrine research in animals often entails exogenous hormone administration. Special issues arise when developing administration protocols for hormones with circadian and seasonal periodicity. This article reviews various methods for the exogenous administration of hormones with such periodicities by focusing on melatonin. We discuss that methodological variations across studies can affect experimental results. Melatonin administration techniques used in vertebrates includes infusion pumps, beeswax pellets, oral administration, injections, SILASTIC capsules, osmotic pumps, transdermal delivery, beads, and sponges.},
