	abstract = {One of the many functions of melatonin in vertebrates is seasonal reproductive timing. Longer nights in winter correspond to an extended duration of melatonin secretion. The purpose of this review is to discuss melatonin synthesis, receptor subtypes, and function in the context of seasonality across vertebrates. We conclude with Tinbergen’s Four Questions to create a comparative framework for future melatonin research in the context of seasonal reproduction.},

	abstract = {Endocrine research in animals often entails exogenous hormone administration. Special issues arise when developing administration protocols for hormones with circadian and seasonal periodicity. This article reviews various methods for the exogenous administration of hormones with such periodicities by focusing on melatonin. We discuss that methodological variations across studies can affect experimental results. Melatonin administration techniques used in vertebrates includes infusion pumps, beeswax pellets, oral administration, injections, SILASTIC capsules, osmotic pumps, transdermal delivery, beads, and sponges.},

	abstract = {Instructor Talk—the noncontent language used by an instructor during class time—is likely to influence learning environments in science classrooms from the student perspective. Despite Instructor Talk being found in every science course thus far, investigations into student perceptions and memories of it are limited. We investigated to what extent undergraduate biology students 1) were aligned with researchers in their perceptions of Instructor Talk as Positively Phrased or Negatively Phrased and 2) remembered Instructor Talk. To test these ideas, we engaged 90 biology students in a multipart assessment. First, students were given randomly selected Instructor Talk quotes, half Positively Phrased and half Negatively Phrased, and were asked to evaluate each quote as promoting a positive or negative learning environment. Overall, students evaluated the Instructor Talk quotes similarly to researchers’ categorizations (p {\textless} 0.0001). Second, students were asked to provide examples of remembered instructor language from their biology courses that they felt promoted a positive or negative learning environment. Most students shared multiple memories, and ∼75\% of these memories could be coded with the Instructor Talk frameworks. Given that students perceive and remember Instructor Talk as impacting the learning environment, Instructor Talk may be an explanatory variable for differential student outcomes across studies of active learning.},
